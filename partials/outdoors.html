        <p class="light left-align">When not working, Greg is outdoors as much as possible. This includes being involved in almost any activity you can think of. Taking the time to enjoy nature allows for better concentration and the ability to work harder, while having an intellectually stimulating job also improves outdoor abilities.</p>

        <p class="light left-align">Greg grew up playing many different sports but focused mainly on soccer. Since then, he has played soccer in men's leagues and has started playing ultimate frisbee to keep his competitive drive satisfied. Running is one of his greatest passions and in that pursuit he has run four marathons and paced friends at ultramarathons.</p>

        <p class="light left-align">While working at Sandia, Greg had a great group of coworkers to go on a run with everyday over lunch. The picture above was when several of them decided to run the Maroon Bells Four Pass Loop. The picture below is of Greg with a coworker whom he paced during her 100-mile ultramarathon.</p>

        <p class="light left-align">Greg has been fortunate enough to travel all over the United States and even a little abroad to sample a wide variety of climbing styles and objectives. His favorite national park is Yosemite, where he sampled some of the best climbs in Tuolumne Meadows. Here he is climbing "On the Lamb", a horizontal crack for four pitches.</p>

        <p class="light left-align">Greg loves living in Colorado where the climate allows for climbing and biking all year long. Above is a nice scramble on the iconic Flatirons. Below Greg is enjoying a quick single track loop that he can ride to from his house. Most evenings he'll be doing one of these activities around town.</p>
