  <p class="light left-align">One of Greg's passions ever since he was young has been working with computers. He began programming in Perl and has since expanded into many other languages including C, C++, Java, Fortran, and his current workhorse, Python. Greg utilizes many of these languages to assist him in his research, as well as in his hobbies. All of his projects and code are available upon request, and many of them are located in his <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas" class="red-text text-darken-4">github repository</a></span>. He regularly contributes to open source projects and is currently one of the maintainers of <a href="https://github.com/scitools/cartopy" class="red-text text-darken-4">Cartopy</a> a geographic plotting library in Python. More details about his current applied programming work is given below.</p>

  <h5 class="header col s12 brown-text text-darken-2">Space Weather Model Staging Platform</h5>
  <p class="light left-align">
    Greg's current programming work involves creating a Model Staging Platform on public cloud architectures to lower the barrier to entry for running research code and getting the cutting edge research into operational centers sooner. An example of this is developing a web interface to an empirical Fortran model so that anyone can interact with the model through a browser without having to worry about compilers or how to run the code. The project involved creating a Python wrapper around the Fortran code (<a href="https://swxtrec.github.io/pymsis/examples/index.html" class="red-text text-darken-4">pymsis</a>) and setting up a serverless application (<a href="https://github.com/SWxTREC/msis-api" class="red-text text-darken-4">msis-api</a>) to call the Fortran code with a web API. The end product is the <a href="https://swxtrec.github.io/msis/visualizer" class="red-text text-darken-4">MSIS Visualizer</a> website that was created with Javascript's d3 library to plot surface geographic fields and altitude profiles of atmospheric constituents depending on the space weather drivers.

    Some other projects that have followed a similar architecture are: <a href="https://swxtrec.github.io/vector/calculator" class="red-text text-darken-4">VECTOR</a>, a satellite drag calculator that enables users to upload a satellite design and choose the orientation and atmospheric conditions to provide a detailed assessment of drag on the vehicle; <a href="https://github.com/SWxTREC/enlilviz" class="red-text text-darken-4">enlilviz</a>, a solar wind visualization program in Python to produce animations and interactive plots for Space Weather Forecasters to use in their operational environments.

    In addition to developing tools for others in the community, Greg also continues to advance the state of the art research in applied machine learning techniques to the spatial and temporal interpolation of magnetic fields. For these techniques he wrote a Spherical Elementary Current System code (<a href="https://github.com/greglucas/pysecs" class="red-text text-darken-4">pysecs</a>) to reduce the problem to a set of divergence-free basis functions, which ensures the underlying physical constraints and properties are maintained while interpolating. He and his colleagues then trained a deep neural network to fit these basis functions using synthetic observations from expensive HPC models that can't be run in real-time. This technique of reducing the dimensionality with physical basis functions and training with large-scale HPC models has shown promise for creating more realistic magnetic field interpolations across North America (<a href="https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10500173.1" class="red-text text-darken-4">poster link</a>).

  <h5 class="header col s12 brown-text text-darken-2">Geoelectric Hazard Analysis</h5>
  <img class="research-img responsive-img" src="./images/geoelectric_field_100.png">
  <p class="light left-align">Greg's postdoc at the USGS involved research on geoelectric hazards and the risk to the nation's power grid from severe space weather events. During this time he developed an open source Python package to deal with a variety of data sources and formats called <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas/bezpy" class="red-text text-darken-4">bezpy</a></span>. Using this package, he conducted geoelectric hazard analyses to identify regions in the United States that are more at risk to geomagnetic storms, shown in the image above. His postdoc culminated in a <span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019SW002329" class="red-text text-darken-4">paper</a></span> that identified the likely magnitude of geoelectric fields and voltages (below) for a once-per-century geomagnetic storm. To advocate for reproducible research, he put all of the code for the paper in a Jupyter notebook that can be found in a <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas/GeoelectricHazardPaper2019" class="red-text text-darken-4">GitHub repository</a></span>.</p>
