  <p class="light left-align">One of Greg's passions ever since he was young has been working with computers. He began programming in Perl and has since expanded into many other languages including C, C++, Java, Fortran, and his current workhorse, Python. Greg utilizes many of these languages to assist him in his research, as well as in his hobbies. All of his projects and code are available upon request, and most of them are located in his <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas" class="red-text text-darken-4">github repository</a></span>.</p>

  <img class="research-img responsive-img" src="./images/geoelectric_field_100.png">
  <p class="light left-align">Greg's postdoc at the USGS involved research on geoelectric hazards and the risk to the nation's power grid from severe space weather events. During this time he developed an open source Python package to deal with a variety of data sources and formats called <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas/bezpy" class="red-text text-darken-4">bezpy</a></span>. Using this package, he conducted geoelectric hazard analyses to identify regions in the United States that are more at risk to geomagnetic storms, shown in the image above. His postdoc culminated in a <span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019SW002329" class="red-text text-darken-4">paper</a></span> that identified the likely magnitude of geoelectric fields and voltages (below) for a once-per-century geomagnetic storm. To advocate for reproducible research, he put all of the code for the paper in a Jupyter notebook that can be found in a <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas/GeoelectricHazardPaper2019" class="red-text text-darken-4">GitHub repository</a></span>.</p>
