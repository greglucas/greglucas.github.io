          <h5 class="header brown-text text-darken-2">Engineer / Scientist</h5>
          <p class="light left-align">Greg is currently a software engineer at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP). He is currently developing a Space Weather Testbed to run operational models in the cloud. He completed his PhD in aerospace engineering sciences at the University of Colorado working with professor <span><a  href="http://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/jeffrey-thayer" class="red-text text-darken-4">Jeffrey Thayer</a></span>. Greg's research focuses on the integration of engineering and fundamental science objectives by applying data fusion techniques to satellite and ground based instrumentation to identify new and unique signals that can't be identified from a single dataset alone. He has extensive experience in applying the appropriate technique(s) (machine learning, time series analysis, fundamental statistics) to identify and report quantifiable results. When not in the lab, Greg spends his time enjoying the numerous outdoor activities Colorado has to offer.</p>

        <p class="light left-align">The Global Electric Circuit involves the investigation of global variations in atmospheric currents and electric fields created by the distribution of thunderstorms. These electrical pathways can be measured to obtain an understanding of different atmospheric parameters. Greg has created a new Global Electric Circuit model for use within large scale climate models.</p>

        <p class="light left-align">Upon completion of his Masters Degree, Greg worked at Sandia National Laboratories on a space nuclear risk analysis team. His responsibilities involved numeric modeling of accident scenarios and probabilities to assess the risk of launching nuclear material into space. Greg's primary mission was risk assessment of the Mars Science Laboratory, which carried a radioisotope power system onboard.</p>
