        <p class="light left-align">The Global Electric Circuit involves the investigation of global variations in atmospheric currents and electric fields created by the distribution of thunderstorms. These electrical pathways can be measured to obtain an understanding of different atmospheric parameters. Greg has created a new Global Electric Circuit model for use within large scale climate models.</p>
