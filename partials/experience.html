        <p class="light left-align">Greg completed his BS in nuclear engineering and MS in medical physics from the University of Wisconsin. After graduating, he took a job at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM where he worked on a launch accident safety team, analyzing the risk associated with rocket launches involving nuclear material. The job allowed him to travel to many places and continue his lifelong learning. The most memorable trip was to Cape Canaveral, where he was able to witness the launch of the Mars Science Laboratory, for which his team wrote the safety analysis report. He then returned to school to complete a PhD in aerospace engineering sciences from the University of Colorado.</p>
